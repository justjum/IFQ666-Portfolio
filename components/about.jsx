        <h2>About</h2>
        <p> Well, hello there.</p>
        <p>What would make a teacher/brewer/musician decide to have a go at the world of software development?</p>
        <p>The appeal lies in utilizing facets from all of my prior careers - creativity, science, machine/control systems, and constant growth to feed an inquisitive mind. I've completed CS50's Intro to Computer Science, and am deep in The Odin Project's Javascript stream - this page provides a taste of the projects that have stemmed from those courses.</p>
